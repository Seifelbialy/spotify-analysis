Argentina Spotify Data Dashboard
This project presents a data visualization dashboard built using Streamlit to analyze Spotify streaming data in Argentina. 
The dashboard provides interactive visualizations for various key metrics such as top-streamed songs, 
artist performance, and streaming trends over time. Users can explore the dataset by selecting different visualizations and answering specific analytical questions through a simple sidebar interface. 
The project also includes a Jupyter Notebook for detailed data analysis, handling missing data, and generating insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA).
This repository demonstrates effective use of Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib,
and seaborn for data manipulation and visualization, making it a great tool for exploring Spotify's Argentina dataset.
